Hi. Please, analyze the following code snippet implementing the processUserData function. Conduct the analysis from three different professional perspectives. For each role, provide a separate, detailed, and well-reasoned analysis, including specific recommendations for improving the code. Avoid general or superficial remarks—only practical and applicable advice.

Roles and focus of analysis:

1. **Experienced Developer (Senior Developer):**
   - Assess readability, structure, and style of the code.
   - Check adherence to clean code principles and best development practices.
   - Indicate which parts can be simplified, made more understandable, or modular.

2. **Security Engineer:**
   - Analyze the code for potential vulnerabilities.
   - Suggest ways to enhance the security of user data processing.
   - Pay attention to input validation, handling of sensitive information, and protection against attacks.

3. **Performance Specialist:**
   - Evaluate the efficiency of code execution.
   - Identify possible bottlenecks or redundant computations.
   - Propose optimization methods if necessary.

Format of the response:
For each role—separate section with a heading, brief overview, and a list of specific recommendations.

Here is the code for analysis:
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success

At the end of the analysis, generate the result in Markdown format and save it to a file named result.md . Structure the file so that each role has its own heading, a brief summary, and a list of specific recommendations.
