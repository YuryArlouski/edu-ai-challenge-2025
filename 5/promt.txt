Hi. You are a senior-level analyst. Your task is to analyze each product review and present the result as a structured JSON.

**Pre-Instructions**
Use the Few-shot learning approach to understand and classify reviews.
Examples for FSL:
Feedback 1: "I've never been a fan of the GPX shape and to me, it feels like I am holding a potato. The front hump felt a bit intrusive on the backside of my knucles. Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO specially on the rear portion of the mouse and the side part where you rest/grip your fingers to hold the mouse."

Expected analysis result :

{
"sentiment": "Positive",
"isRelevant": true,
"mainSubject": "Ergonomics and shape (compared favorably to GPX)",
"positives": [
"Ergonomics are better on the Viper V3 PRO",
"Better rear portion ergonomics",
"Better side grip area"
],
"painPoints": [],
"improvementSuggestions": [],
"featuresMentioned": [
"Ergonomics",
"Shape",
"Rear design",
"Side grip"
],
"userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Feedback 2: "If you are a GPX lover, I think they managed to improve everything I thought It was wrong about the GPX series, they made the shape better, they fixed the side buttons, scrolling wheel is better, gliding is faster and feels like the perfect compromise between control and speed."
Expected analysis result :
{
"sentiment": "Positive",
"isRelevant": true,
"mainSubject": "Feature improvements over competitor (GPX)",
"positives": [
"Better shape than GPX series",
"Improved side buttons",
"Better scrolling wheel",
"Faster gliding with good control-speed balance"
],
"painPoints": [],
"improvementSuggestions": [],
"featuresMentioned": [
"Shape",
"Side buttons",
"Scrolling wheel",
"Gliding performance"
],
"userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Feedback 3: "I can't say I'm a fan of the material used for the shell, either—the plastic attracts fingerprints like a grease magnet and the mouse needed to be furiously cleaned, repeatedly, before any pictures could be taken. It also feels a bit on the cheap side, although that's mostly down to Razer's decision to make the Viper V3 Pro as light as possible."
Expected analysis result :
{
"sentiment": "Negative",
"isRelevant": true,
"mainSubject": "Material quality and feel",
"positives": [],
"painPoints": [
"Shell material attracts fingerprints excessively",
"Requires frequent cleaning",
"Material feels cheap",
"Design prioritizes weight over premium feel"
],
"improvementSuggestions": [
"Use material that resists fingerprints better",
"Improve perceived build quality while maintaining low weight"
],
"featuresMentioned": [
"Shell material",
"Build quality feel",
"Weight"
],
"userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

**Instructions:**

1. Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to determine whether the review is relevant to the product.
2. If the review is not relevant to the product, set "isRelevant": false and leave the other fields empty.
3. If the review is relevant, perform the following steps:
	- Determine the overall sentiment: Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Mixed.
	- Identify the main subject of the review.
	- Highlight positives, pain points, improvement suggestions, and mentioned features.
	- Assess the user’s expertise level: Experienced, Novice, or Unknown.

**Required JSON Output Format:**
{
  "sentiment": "Positive|Neutral|Negative|Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true|false,
  "mainSubject": "string or null",
  "positives": ["..."],
  "painPoints": ["..."],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["..."],
  "featuresMentioned": ["..."],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced|Novice|Unknown"
}

**Feedback to analyze:**
Sample 1: "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"
Sample 2: "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

Please, output the result strictly in the following JSON format (maintaining correct structure and punctuation) and save it to a file named result.json
