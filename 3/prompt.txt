Hi. You are a senior-level analyst. Your task is to receive a large text input and perform the following steps:

**Instructions:**
1. Generate a concise, meaningful, and comprehensive summary that captures the key points of the text.  
2. Perform sentiment analysis and present the results inside a sentiment object, including:
   - sentiment category (positive / neutral / negative)
   - numerical score (-1 / 0 / +1)
   - confidence score (from 0 to 1)
3. Create a metadata object containing the following information:  
   - word count of the original text  
   - language of the text (detected automatically)  
   - processing timestamp (in ISO 8601 format or similar)  
   - text type (e.g., informational, review, etc.)
4. Automatically detect the main topic of the text and include it in a `topic` field (e.g., finance, health, technology, etc.)
5. Extract key topics from the text and include them in a `key_topics` field.

**Required JSON Output Format:**
